# ZPlan
The Distributed Application Architecture.

#### Ultimate Goal

> Building Earth-based Cellular Computing Services.

+ So that everyone can access the computing network at the lowest cost.
  + The consumption of extended computing model is minimized.
  + The consumption of maintenance computing model is minimized.
+ The data is completely separated from the GUI, and the end-user has the highest GUI control.
+ Use self-similar management strategies to reduce the formation of DSL.

+ Make infrastructure everywhere in the human footprint.
+ Computing model is hardware independent.
